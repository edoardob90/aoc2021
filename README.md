# Advent of Code 2021 üë®‚ÄçüíªüéÑüéÖ

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a coding challenge from December 1st until Christmas created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The first puzzles will unlock as usual at Midnight (UTC-5) on December the 1st.

I will attempt to write a solution in **at least two** out of the three following languages:

1. **Python** ‚Äî because... well, it's üêç
2. **C** ‚Äî it's supported almost everywhere, plus a low-level language lets you build everything from the very bottom, so you really have to understand what you are doing
3. **Wolfram Language** ‚Äî it's been the first language I learned (before high-school), and is wonderfully compact and elegant

To run Python solutions any 3.x version should work fine, otherwise I will specify. C solutions should compile with any reasonably recent C compiler (GCC, Clang). To run Wolfram Language, an [interpreter](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript) must be installed first and a [Wolfram Kernel](https://www.wolfram.com/engine) is required to run the script locally.


## Progress

I'll be publishing my daily progress ‚Äì with some comments on my solution (if I found it) and what I learned ‚Äì on Hashnode. Follow me there!
