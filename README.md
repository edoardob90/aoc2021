# Advent of Code 2021 üíªüéÑüéÖ

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a coding challenge from December 1st until Christmas created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). The puzzles will unlock as usual at Midnight (UTC-5) on each day from the 1st to the 25th of December.

Each folder corresponds to a day of the calendar and, in each folder, the `README.md` contains the first part of the day's puzzle. To unlock the second part, you must submit the correct solution that you obtained with your input.

As the inputs are different for each user, use the `input.txt` files in each day's folder only if you want to test a different solution against my inputs.

## Languages used

I will attempt to write a solution in **at least two** of the three following languages:

1. **Python** ‚Äî because... well, it's üêç
2. **C** ‚Äî it's supported almost everywhere, plus a low-level language lets you build everything from the very bottom, so you really have to understand what you are doing
3. **Wolfram Language** ‚Äî it's been the first language I learned (before high-school), and is wonderfully compact and elegant

To run Python solutions any 3.x version should work fine, otherwise I will specify. C solutions should compile with any reasonably recent C compiler (GCC, Clang). To run Wolfram Language, an [interpreter](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript) must be installed first and a [Wolfram Kernel](https://www.wolfram.com/engine) is required to run the script locally.


## Progress

I'll be publishing my daily progress ‚Äì with some comments on my solution (if I found it) and what I learned ‚Äì on Hashnode. [ Follow me ](https://hashnode.com/@edobld) there!

For reference, here's an up-to-date list with the links to my blog entries where I talked about each day's problem (P = Python, WL = Wolfram Language)
